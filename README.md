# nativescript-ui-gradient
While working on a Mobile App project, I saw a desire to implement gradient designs on various UI elements but there isn't something that is adaptable and flexible enough to do that. So this repository serves to hold the project for the full dev version of the plugin. A separate repository will be created to house just the plugin itself for production environment.
